# mkpass

`mkpass` is a CLI utility to generate passwords from the command-line.  All
random characters are generated by `/dev/urandom`.

By default passwords are 64 characters long and may contain any printable ASCII
character.  If you would like to specify the password length, you can use the
`-l` command-line option.  If you would like to specify the set of characters to
use in the password, you can provide a set of characters or a range in the same
form as `tr(1)`.

For example to generate a 40 character long password containing only the numbers
0–9 and the uppercase-characters A–F:

    $ mkpass -l 40 0-9A-F
    379A2E98B2BE03A5F4B2F5AC39F4FD8429B2CAFD
